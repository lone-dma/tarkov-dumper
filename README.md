## What is this?
- This is an up-to-date build of Lone DMA EFT/Arena offset dumper/generator.

## How do I start using this?

2. Open solution with visual studio
3. Modify the `Assembly-CSharp.dll`, `dump.txt` & `SDK.cs` paths in `EFTProcessor.cs` & `ArenaProcessor.cs` to your liking
4. Make the appropriate folder hierarchy mentioned above, also place your Unispect `dump.txt` & game `Assembly-CSharp.dll` in said folders (Default is `C:\lone-dma\eft\` & `C:\lone-dma\arena\`)
3. Run the `TarkovDumper` project in Debug/Release & it will generate an `SDK.cs` for both EFT & Arena in their respective folders
